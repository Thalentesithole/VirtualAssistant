# VirtualAssistant
Python task automation
This is a Python-based custom voice assistant project, I completed during my internship at Hex Softwares that allows users to customise and automate tasks based on their needs. Python was a great choice for scripting and development this project because of its adaptability, which enables us to create a voice assistant that can challenge Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
